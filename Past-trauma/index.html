  <p>Past traumas are hard to pinpoint. As we grow into adulthood, we may find less time to deal with our problems and it seems easier to set them aside.</p>

  <p2></p2>

  <p3>
    According to How Trauma May Impact Adults, it says, “Trauma can lead to PTSD.” This is why it's important to get unresolved trauma solved.
    According to the article on Help.org, “Trauma affects more than just your mind. It can also have long-term physical consequences.” The article explains how your body keeps
    stress hormones high, which can alter blood pressure. What we can take from this explanation is that when stress hormones are present at all times resulting from trauma, an adult
    cannot live and maintain a healthy life. Focus will be lost, constant questioning of oneself can lead to lost opportunities, and a closure to people around them.

        <h3>“Hidden Trauma in Adulthood”</h3>
        <p class="story-meta">From a survivor story on The Survivors Trust.</p>
        <p>
          A woman in her 40's has lived life with a burden and trauma in the back of her mind. She describes that she would live life but would
          always have a lingering thought in the back of her mind about what her brother had done to her. She says that she felt trapped in a mental sense. As she went through life,
          she had to make a choice. That choice was to talk to her brother about the past trauma he had caused. She explains that although it was hard, she feels the experience healed her.
          She explains that it felt as though a weight was lifted off her. This story shows us adults why setting aside our past traumas and using other means to forget about them is not
          the solution. We must face the problems and fix them.

        <h3>"From pain to pride"</h3>
        <p class="story-meta">Dealing with trauma</p>
        <p>
          The story here is presented by a young adult who suffered from a lack of parenthood. She describes her father struggled with bipolar disorder and would isolate himself from his family.
          He showed no affection to the writer and later took his own life from suicide. The writer explains that journaling helped deal with her trauma, but she stopped journaling over time
          due to her becoming an adult and having less and less time. As time went on, she describes her mental state from the trauma had led her into a mental spiral and she almost lost herself in the
          process. She later went back to journaling and felt as though she was continuing to rehabilitate herself. This story shows that trauma may not always be resolved fully, but treating them with positive outlets,
          as Freud says, helps keep a person's mind healthy.

        <h1>Why can past traumas affect future?</h1>
        <p class="lead">
          Past traumas can affect the future due to the inability to handle certain situations that you would be able to handle easier without the traumas. Opportunities may be missed because past traumas cause self-esteem issues, anger management issues, and issues missing out on opportunities and losing connections.
          This can be due to the inability to overcome them. Once identified, we are able to hit the source and work on healing from them.
